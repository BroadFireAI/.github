# BroadFire AI

**Open research in spatial intelligence, neurosymbolic reasoning, mechanistic interpretability, and embodied AI.**

---

We are a small, independent research group working on foundational problems at the intersection of 3D spatial understanding, world models, and structured reasoning. Our work is guided by the belief that the next generation of intelligent systems must move beyond flat pattern matching toward compositional, physically grounded understanding of the world.

## Research Directions

### Spatial Intelligence & World Models

We develop methods for real-time 3D scene understanding — monocular depth estimation, Gaussian splatting, and spatiotemporal representations that capture how environments evolve over time. Our interest extends to world models: learned simulators of environment dynamics that enable agents to predict, plan, and act within physical spaces before committing to action.

### Neurosymbolic & Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning

We design architectures that combine neural perception with symbolic program induction — enabling agents to discover compositional task structure, learn transferable hierarchical policies, and generalise to novel environments zero-shot. The goal is agents that reason, not just react.

### Mechanistic Interpretability

We study the internal representations of neural networks to understand *how* and *why* models behave as they do. Our interpretability work informs the design of more transparent, steerable AI systems.

### Scientific Machine Learning

We contribute to the Julia and Python scientific computing ecosystems, particularly in medical imaging, volumetric segmentation, and differentiable scientific computing through the [JuliaHealth](https://github.com/JuliaHealth) and [SciML](https://github.com/SciML) organisations.
